### Do not quit
---
When things go wrong as they sometimes will;  
When the road you're trudging(跋涉) seems all uphill;  
When the funds are low,and debts are high;  
And you want to smile ,but have to sigh ;  
When care(烦恼) is pressing you down a bit;  
Rest if you must ,but do not quit.  
 
Success is Failure turned inside out;  
The silver tint(一丝痕迹) of the  clouds of doubt; 
And you can never tell how close you are.  
It may be near when it seems so far;  
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit;  
It's when things go wrong that you must not quit.

>译文  
当事情有时出现问题;  
当要走的时候似乎全是上坡路;  
当囊中羞涩,债台高筑;  
你想微笑,却惟有叹息;  
当烦忧让你受着点打击;
这些时候,若不得已就歇歇吧,但不要放弃.  
 
>成功就是"失败"翻个底儿;  
仿佛疑云的银边儿;  
你永远不知道自己离成功还有多远.  
那路程看似远时或已近;  
所以打击最大时就斗争到底吧;  
每当事情变糟,正是你绝不能放弃的时候.
